# Module 2 Configure production prerequisites

## Case study 1A Discrete, Process and Lean manufacturing features

### Exercise \#1: Update the production control parameters

When you are starting to use the Production control module, you are required to do some configurations that will help the system operate according to your design and process design.

The Operations manager at USMF,  wants to make some changes to the policies so everything runs more efficiently. He wants to be sure routes are not allowed to be modified or have their approvals removed. In order to accomplish this, a new route operation should be created, and the effective dates updated.

Can you help the operation manager to perform this?

You will have to do the following:

- Update the production control parameters

#### Steps

1. Go to **Production control \> Setup \> Production control parameters**.
2. Set the **Block removal of approval** slider to **Yes** under the **Routes** group.
